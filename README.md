## Function Details

### 1. Detachable Fully Automated Memory Module (`mem0`)
LightAgent supports external extensions of the `mem0` memory module, automating context memory and historical record management without requiring developers to manually trigger memory addition and retrieval. With the memory module, the agent can maintain contextual consistency across multiple rounds of dialogue.

```python
# Enable Memory Module

# Or use a custom memory module, here is an example with mem0 https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0/
from mem0 import Memory
from LightAgent import LightAgent
import os
from loguru import logger

class CustomMemory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memories = []
        os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key"
        os.environ["OPENAI_API_BASE"] = "your_base_url"
        # Initialize Mem0
        config = {
            "version": "v1.1"
        }
        # Use qdrant as a vector database for storing memories in mem0, change config to the code below
        # config = {
        #     "vector_store": {
        #         "provider": "qdrant",
        #         "config": {
        #             "host": "localhost",
        #             "port": 6333,
        #         }
        #     },
        #     "version": "v1.1"
        # }
        self.m = Memory.from_config(config_dict=config)

    def store(self, data: str, user_id):
        """Store memory. Developers can modify the internal implementation of the storage method; the current example is the mem0 method for adding memory."""
        result = self.m.add(data, user_id=user_id)
        return result

    def retrieve(self, query: str, user_id):
        """Retrieve related memory. Developers can modify the internal implementation of the retrieval method; the current example is the mem0 method for searching memory."""
        result = self.m.search(query, user_id=user_id)
        return result

agent = LightAgent(
        role="Please remember that you are LightAgent, a useful assistant to help users use multiple tools.",  # system role description
        model="deepseek-chat",  # Supported models: openai, chatglm, deepseek, qwen, etc.
        api_key="your_api_key",  # Replace with your large model provider API Key
        base_url="your_base_url",  # Replace with your large model provider api url
        memory=CustomMemory(),  # Enable memory function
        tree_of_thought=False,  # Enable Chain of Thought
    )

# Memory-enabled test & if tools need to be added, you can add tools to the agent for memory-enabled tool calls

user_id = "user_01"
logger.info("\n=========== next conversation ===========")
query = "Introduce me to the attractions in Sanya. Many of my friends have traveled to Sanya, and I want to visit too."
print(agent.run(query, stream=False, user_id=user_id))
logger.info("\n=========== next conversation ===========")
query = "Where should I travel?"

    name="Agent A",  # Agent name
    instructions="You are a helpful agent.",  # Role description
    role="Please remember that you are a tool generator; your task is to automatically generate corresponding tool code based on the text description provided by the user and save it to the specified directory. Please ensure that the generated code is accurate, usable, and meets the user's needs.",  # Tool generator's role description
    model="deepseek-chat",  # Replace with your model. Supported models: openai, chatglm, deepseek, qwen, etc.
    api_key="your_api_key",  # Replace with your API Key
    base_url="your_base_url",  # Replace with your API URL
)

# Sample text description
text = """
The Sina stock interface provides functionalities for obtaining stock market data, including stock quotes, real-time trading data, and K-line chart data.

Introduction to Sina stock interface functions
1. Get stock quote data:
Realtime quote data: Using the real-time quote API, you can obtain the latest prices, trading volume, and changes for stocks.
Minute line quote data: Using the minute line quote API, you can obtain the minute-by-minute trading data for stocks, including opening price, closing price, highest price, and lowest price.

2. Obtain historical K-line chart data:
K-line chart data: Through the K-line chart API, you can obtain the historical trading data for stocks, including opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, trading volume, etc. You can choose different time periods and moving average periods as needed.
Adjusted data: You can choose to retrieve adjusted K-line data, including pre-adjusted and post-adjusted data, for more accurate analysis of stock price changes.

Example of obtaining data from the Sina stock interface
1. Get stock quote data:
API address: http://hq.sinajs.cn/list=[stock_code]
Example: To obtain real-time quote data for the stock code "sh600519" (Kweichow Moutai), you can use the following API address: http://hq.sinajs.cn/list=sh600519
By sending an HTTP GET request to the above API address, you will receive a response containing the real-time data for that stock.

2. Get historical K-line chart data:
API address: http://money.finance.sina.com.cn/quotes_service/api/json_v2.php/CN_MarketData.getKLineData?symbol=[stock_code]&scale=[time_period]&ma=[average_period]&datalen=[data_length]
Example: To obtain daily K-line chart data for the stock code "sh600519" (Kweichow Moutai), you can use the following API address: http://money.finance.sina.com.cn/quotes_service/api/json_v2.php/CN_MarketData.getKLineData?symbol=sh600519&scale=240&ma=no&datalen=1023
By sending an HTTP GET request to the above API address, you will receive a response containing the historical K-line chart data for that stock.
"""

# Build the path to the tools directory
project_root = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
tools_directory = os.path.join(project_root, "tools")

# Create tools directory if it does not exist
if not os.path.exists(tools_directory):
    os.makedirs(tools_directory)

print(f"Tools directory has been created: {tools_directory}")

# Use agent to generate tool code
agent.create_tool(text, tools_directory=tools_directory)
```
After execution, two files will be generated in the tools directory: get_stock_kline_data.py and get_stock_realtime_data.py.

### 4. Tree of Thought (ToT)
The built-in Tree of Thought module supports complex task decomposition and multi-step reasoning. Through the Tree of Thought, the agent can better handle complex tasks.

```python
# Enable Tree of Thought
agent = LightAgent(
    model="qwen-turbo-2024-11-01", 
    api_key="your_api_key", 
    base_url="your_base_url", 
    tree_of_thought=True,  # Enable Tree of Thought
)
```

### 5. Multi-Agent Collaboration
Supports swarm-like multi-agent collaboration, enhancing task processing efficiency. Multiple agents can work together to complete complex tasks.

```python
from LightAgent import LightAgent, LightSwarm
# Set Environment Variables OPENAI_API_KEY and OPENAI_BASE_URL
# The default model uses gpt-4o-mini

# Create an instance of LightSwarm
light_swarm = LightSwarm()

# Create multiple agents
agent_a = LightAgent(
    name="Agent A",
    instructions="I am Agent A, the front desk receptionist.",
    role="Receptionist responsible for welcoming visitors and providing basic information guidance. Before each reply, please state your identity and that you can only guide users to other roles, not directly answer business questions. If you cannot help the user, please respond: Sorry, I am currently unable to assist!"
)

agent_b = LightAgent(
    name="Agent B",
    instructions="I am Agent B, responsible for the reservation of meeting rooms.",
    role="Meeting room reservation administrator in charge of handling reservations, cancellations, and inquiries for meeting rooms 1, 2, and 3."
)

agent_c = LightAgent(
    name="Agent C",
    instructions="I am Agent C, a technical support specialist, responsible for handling technical issues. Please state your identity before each reply, offering detailed responses to technical inquiries, and guide users to contact higher-level technical support for issues beyond your capability."
)

agent_d = LightAgent(
    name="Agent D",
    instructions="I am Agent D, an HR specialist, responsible for handling HR-related questions.",
    role="HR specialist managing inquiries and processes related to employee onboarding, offboarding, leave, and benefits."
)

# Automatically register agents to the LightSwarm instance
