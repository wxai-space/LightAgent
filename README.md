## Function Details

### 1. Detachable Fully Automated Memory Module (`mem0`)
LightAgent supports external extensions of the `mem0` memory module, automating context memory and historical record management without requiring developers to manually trigger memory addition and retrieval. With the memory module, the agent can maintain contextual consistency across multiple rounds of dialogue.

```python
# Enable Memory Module

# Or use a custom memory module, here is an example with mem0 https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0/
from mem0 import Memory
from LightAgent import LightAgent
import os
from loguru import logger

class CustomMemory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memories = []
        os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key"
        os.environ["OPENAI_API_BASE"] = "your_base_url"
        # Initialize Mem0
        config = {
            "version": "v1.1"
        }
        # Use qdrant as a vector database for storing memories in mem0, change config to the code below
        # config = {
        #     "vector_store": {
        #         "provider": "qdrant",
        #         "config": {
        #             "host": "localhost",
        #             "port": 6333,
        #         }
        #     },
        #     "version": "v1.1"
        # }
        self.m = Memory.from_config(config_dict=config)

    def store(self, data: str, user_id):
        """Store memory. Developers can modify the internal implementation of the storage method; the current example is the mem0 method for adding memory."""
        result = self.m.add(data, user_id=user_id)
        return result

    def retrieve(self, query: str, user_id):
        """Retrieve related memory. Developers can modify the internal implementation of the retrieval method; the current example is the mem0 method for searching memory."""
        result = self.m.search(query, user_id=user_id)
        return result

agent = LightAgent(
        role="Please remember that you are LightAgent, a useful assistant to help users use multiple tools.",  # system role description
        model="gpt-4.1",  # Supported models: openai, chatglm, deepseek, qwen, etc.
        api_key="your_api_key",  # Replace with your large model provider API Key
        base_url="your_base_url",  # Replace with your large model provider api url
        memory=CustomMemory(),  # Enable memory function
        tree_of_thought=False,  # Enable Chain of Thought
    )

# Memory-enabled test & if tools need to be added, you can add tools to the agent for memory-enabled tool calls

user_id = "user_01"
logger.info("\n=========== next conversation ===========")
query = "Introduce me to the attractions in Sanya. Many of my friends have traveled to Sanya, and I want to visit too."

### 3. Tool Generator
The Tool Generator is a module for automatically generating tool code. It can create the corresponding tool code based on the text description provided by users and save it to the specified directory. This functionality is particularly useful for quickly generating API call tools, data processing tools, and more.

Usage example

Here is an example code using the Tool Generator:

```python
import json
import os
import sys
from LightAgent import LightAgent

# Initialize LightAgent
agent = LightAgent(
    name="Agent A",  # Agent name
    instructions="You are a helpful agent.",  # Role description
    role="Please remember that you are a tool generator; your task is to automatically generate corresponding tool code based on the text description provided by the user and save it to the specified directory. Please ensure that the generated code is accurate, usable, and meets the user's needs.",  # Tool generator's role description
    model="gpt-4.1",  # Replace with your model. Supported models: openai, chatglm, deepseek, qwen, etc.
    api_key="your_api_key",  # Replace with your API Key
    base_url="your_base_url",  # Replace with your API URL
)

# Sample text description
text = """
The Sina stock interface provides functionalities for obtaining stock market data, including stock quotes, real-time trading data, and K-line chart data.

Introduction to Sina stock interface functions
1. Get stock quote data:
Realtime quote data: Using the real-time quote API, you can obtain the latest prices, trading volume, and changes for stocks.
Minute line quote data: Using the minute line quote API, you can obtain the minute-by-minute trading data for stocks, including opening price, closing price, highest price, and lowest price.

2. Obtain historical K-line chart data:
K-line chart data: Through the K-line chart API, you can obtain the historical trading data for stocks, including opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, trading volume, etc. You can choose different time periods and moving average periods as needed.
Adjusted data: You can choose to retrieve adjusted K-line data, including pre-adjusted and post-adjusted data, for more accurate analysis of stock price changes.

Example of obtaining data from the Sina stock interface
1. Get stock quote data:
API address: http://hq.sinajs.cn/list=[stock_code]
Example: To obtain real-time quote data for the stock code "sh600519" (Kweichow Moutai), you can use the following API address: http://hq.sinajs.cn/list=sh600519
By sending an HTTP GET request to the above API address, you will receive a response containing the real-time data for that stock.

2. Get historical K-line chart data:
API address: http://money.finance.sina.com.cn/quotes_service/api/json_v2.php/CN_MarketData.getKLineData?symbol=[stock_code]&scale=[time_period]&ma=[average_period]&datalen=[data_length]
Example: To obtain daily K-line chart data for the stock code "sh600519" (Kweichow Moutai), you can use the following API address: http://money.finance.sina.com.cn/quotes_service/api/json_v2.php/CN_MarketData.getKLineData?symbol=sh600519&scale=240&ma=no&datalen=1023
By sending an HTTP GET request to the above API address, you will receive a response containing the historical K-line chart data for that stock.
"""

# Build the path to the tools directory
project_root = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
tools_directory = os.path.join(project_root, "tools")

# Create tools directory if it does not exist
if not os.path.exists(tools_directory):
    os.makedirs(tools_directory)

print(f"Tools directory has been created: {tools_directory}")

# Use agent to generate tool code
agent.create_tool(text, tools_directory=tools_directory)
```
After execution, two files will be generated in the tools directory: get_stock_kline_data.py and get_stock_realtime_data.py.

### 4. Tree of Thought (ToT)
Currently, it is already supported to independently customize the use of the deepseek-r1 model for planning and thinking.The built-in Tree of Thought module supports complex task decomposition and multi-step reasoning. Through the Tree of Thought, the agent can better handle complex tasks.

    model="gpt-4.1", 
    api_key="your_api_key", 
    base_url="your_base_url", 
    tree_of_thought=True,  # Enable Tree of Thought
    tot_model="gpt-4o", 
    tot_api_key="sk-uXx0H0B***17778F1",  # your deepseek r1 API Key
    tot_base_url="https://api.openai.com/v1",  # api url
    filter_tools=False,  # Disable the adaptive tool mechanism
)
```
After enabling ToT, the adaptive tool mechanism is enabled by default. If you need to disable it, please add the parameter filter_tools=False when initializing LightAgent.

### 5. Multi-Agent Collaboration
Supports swarm-like multi-agent collaboration, enhancing task processing efficiency. Multiple agents can work together to complete complex tasks.

```python
from LightAgent import LightAgent, LightSwarm
# Set Environment Variables OPENAI_API_KEY and OPENAI_BASE_URL
# The default model uses gpt-4o-mini

# Create an instance of LightSwarm
light_swarm = LightSwarm()

# Create multiple agents
agent_a = LightAgent(
    name="Agent A",
    instructions="I am Agent A, the front desk receptionist.",
    role="Receptionist responsible for welcoming visitors and providing basic information guidance. Before each reply, please state your identity and that you can only guide users to other roles, not directly answer business questions. If you cannot help the user, please respond: Sorry, I am currently unable to assist!"
)

agent_b = LightAgent(
    name="Agent B",
    instructions="I am Agent B, responsible for the reservation of meeting rooms.",
    role="Meeting room reservation administrator in charge of handling reservations, cancellations, and inquiries for meeting rooms 1, 2, and 3."
)

agent_c = LightAgent(
    name="Agent C",
    instructions="I am Agent C, a technical support specialist, responsible for handling technical issues. Please state your identity before each reply, offering detailed responses to technical inquiries, and guide users to contact higher-level technical support for issues beyond your capability."
)

agent_d = LightAgent(
    name="Agent D",
    instructions="I am Agent D, an HR specialist, responsible for handling HR-related questions.",
    role="HR specialist managing inquiries and processes related to employee onboarding, offboarding, leave, and benefits."
)

# Automatically register agents to the LightSwarm instance
light_swarm.register_agent(agent_a, agent_b, agent_c, agent_d)

# Run Agent A
res = light_swarm.run(agent=agent_a, query="Hello, I am Alice. I need to check if Wang Xiaoming has completed onboarding.", stream=False)
print(res)
```
Output as follows:
```python
Hello, I am Agent D, the HR specialist. Regarding whether Wang Xiaoming has completed onboarding, I need to check our system records. Please wait a moment.
(Checking system records...)
According to our records, Wang Xiaoming completed his onboarding procedures on January 5, 2025. He has signed all necessary documents and has been assigned an employee number and office location. If you need further details or have any other questions, please feel free to contact the HR department. We are always ready to assist you.
```

### 6. Streaming API 
Supports OpenAI streaming format API service output, seamlessly integrating with mainstream chat frameworks.

```python
# Enable streaming output
response = agent.run("Please generate an article about AI.", stream=True)
for chunk in response:
    print(chunk)
```

### 7. Agent Self-Learning
The Agent possesses a unique scene memory capability, allowing it to accurately retain key information from interactions with users. At the same time, it has a powerful ability to extract knowledge from user dialogues and engage in self-learning, continuously optimizing its understanding and response strategies for various scenarios with each conversation, thereby achieving a continuous improvement in intelligence levels to better meet the diverse needs of users. Through this self-learning mechanism, the Agent can continuously adapt to complex and changing task scenarios, providing users with higher quality, more efficient, and personalized services.
```python
agent = LightAgent(
        name="Agent A",  # Agent name
        instructions="You are a helpful agent.",  # Role description
        role="Please remember that you are LightAgent, a useful assistant to help users use multiple tools.",  # system role description
        model="gpt-4.1",  # Supported models: openai, chatglm, deepseek, qwen, etc. qwen-turbo-2024-11-01 \ step-1-flash
        api_key="your_api_key",  # Replace with your API Key
        base_url="http://your_base_url/v1",  # API URL
        memory=CustomMemory(),  # Enable memory function
        self_learning=True,  # Enable agent self-learning
        debug=True,
        log_level="DEBUG",
        log_file="example.log"
    )

user_id = "test_user_1"
query = "I now have a procurement payment that needs to be transferred. What is my approval process?"
agent.run(query, stream=False, user_id=user_id)
query = "Please remember: According to the new company regulations, starting from January 2025, all procurement payments must first be signed by Manager Ding, who is responsible for procurement, then submitted to the finance manager for approval. After the finance manager's approval, the general manager of the company must also approve before the cashier can make the payment."
agent.run(query, stream=False, user_id=user_id)

user_id = "test_user_2"
query = "Hello, I have a procurement payment to transfer to the other party. How do I apply for the transfer?"
agent.run(query, stream=False, user_id=user_id)

```

### 8. Integrating Langfuse Log Tracking

LightAgent integrates with the [Langfuse open-source platform](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse), providing full-link monitoring and log analysis capabilities, real-time tracking of key metrics such as token consumption and response latency, and supporting interactive data management and version control. The platform's visualization analysis features clearly display the core decision-making processes of the Agent, such as context retrieval and tool invocation, and fully record user interaction flows.
```python
from LightAgent import LightAgent

tracetools = {
    "TraceTool": "langfuse",
    "TraceToolConfig": {
        "langfuse_enabled": True,
        "langfuse_host": "https://cloud.langfuse.com",
        "langfuse_public_key": "pk-lf-9fedb073-a*86-4**5-b**2-52****1b1**7",
        "langfuse_secret_key": "sk-lf-27bdbdec-c**6-4**3-a**2-28**0140**c7"
    }
}

agent = LightAgent(
        name="Agent A",  # Agent Name
        instructions="You are a helpful agent.",  # Role Description
        role="Please remember that you are LightAgent, a useful assistant to help users use multiple tools.",  # system role description
        model="gpt-4o-mini",  # Supported models: openai, chatglm, deepseek, qwen, etc. qwen-turbo-2024-11-01 \ step-1-flash
        api_key="your_api_key",  # Replace with your API Key
        base_url="http://your_base_url/v1",  # API URL
        debug=True,
        log_level="DEBUG",
        log_file="example.log",
        tracetools=tracetools
    )
```
The LLM call logs tracked by Langfuse are shown in the figure below:
