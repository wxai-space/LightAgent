## Detailed Function Descriptions

### 1. Detachable Fully Automated Memory Module (`mem0`)
LightAgent supports external extension of the `mem0` memory module for fully automated context memory and historical record management without manual triggering of memory addition and retrieval by developers. Through the memory module, agents can maintain contextual consistency over multiple conversation rounds.

```python
# Enable Memory Module

# Or use a custom memory module, here we use mem0 as an example https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0/
from mem0 import Memory
from LightAgent import LightAgent
import os
from loguru import logger

class CustomMemory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memories = []
        os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key"
        os.environ["OPENAI_API_BASE"] = "your_base_url"
        # Initialize Mem0
        config = {
            "version": "v1.1"
        }
        # If using qdrant as a vector database in mem0 to store memories, change config to the code below
        # config = {
        #     "vector_store": {
        #         "provider": "qdrant",
        #         "config": {
        #             "host": "localhost",
        #             "port": 6333,
        #         }
        #     },
        #     "version": "v1.1"
        # }
        self.m = Memory.from_config(config_dict=config)

    def store(self, data: str, user_id):
        """Store memory developers can modify the internal implementation of the storage method, the current example is mem0's memory addition method"""
        result = self.m.add(data, user_id=user_id)
        return result

    def retrieve(self, query: str, user_id):
        """Retrieve related memory developers can modify the internal implementation of the retrieval method, the current example is mem0's memory searching method"""
        result = self.m.search(query, user_id=user_id)
        return result

agent = LightAgent(
        role="Please remember you are LightAgent, a helpful assistant that can help users utilize multiple tools.",  # system role description
        model="deepseek-chat",  # Supported models: openai, chatglm, deepseek, qwen, etc.
        api_key="your_api_key",  # Replace with your large model service provider API Key
        base_url="your_base_url",  # Replace with your large model service provider api url
        memory=CustomMemory(),  # Enable memory functionality
        tree_of_thought=False,  # Enable Thought Chain
    )

# Memory tests & If tools need to be added, they can be added to the agent to realize memory-enabled tool calls

user_id = "user_01"
logger.info("\n=========== next conversation ===========")
query = "Introduce some fun attractions in Sanya, many of my friends have traveled to Sanya, and I also want to go play."
print(agent.run(query, stream=False, user_id=user_id))
logger.info("\n=========== next conversation ===========")
query = "Where do I want to travel?"
print(agent.run(query, stream=False, user_id=user_id))
```

query = "What is the current weather like in Sanya?"
response = agent.run(query, stream=False)  # Use agent to run the query
print(response)
```

### 3. Tools Generator
The Tools Generator is a module for automating the generation of tool code. It can automatically generate the corresponding tool code based on the text description provided by the user and save it to a specified directory. This function is particularly suitable for quickly generating API calling tools, data processing tools, and other scenarios.

Usage example

Here’s an example of using the Tools Generator:

```python
import json
import os
import sys
from LightAgent import LightAgent

# Initialize LightAgent
agent = LightAgent(
    name="Agent A",  # Agent name
    instructions="You are a helpful agent.",  # Role description
    role="Please remember you are a tool generator, your task is to automatically generate corresponding tool code based on the text description provided by the user and save it to the specified directory. Please ensure that the generated code is accurate, usable, and meets the user's needs.",  # Tool generator's role description
    model="deepseek-chat",  # Replace with your model. Supported models: openai, chatglm, deepseek, qwen, etc.
    api_key="your_api_key",  # Replace with your API Key
    base_url="your_base_url",  # Replace with your API URL
)

# Sample text description
text = """
The Sina Stock API provides functionality for obtaining stock market data, including stock quotes, real-time trading data, K-line data, etc.

Sina Stock API Functional Introduction
1. Get Stock Quote Data:
Real-time quote data: Use the real-time quote API to obtain the latest quotes, transaction volumes, price changes, and other information for stocks.
Minute line quote data: Use the minute line API to obtain the minute-by-minute trading data for stocks, including opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, etc.

2. Get Historical K-line Data for Stocks:
K-line data: Through the K-line API, you can obtain historical transaction data for stocks, including opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, transaction volume, etc. You can choose different time periods and moving average cycles as needed.
Stock dividends data: You can choose to get stock price data adjusted for dividends, including forward and backward adjustments, to analyze stock price changes more accurately.

Sample of Getting Data from the Sina Stock API
1. Get Stock Quote Data:
API Address: http://hq.sinajs.cn/list=[Stock Code]
Example: To get the real-time quote data for the stock code "sh600519" (Kweichou Moutai), you can use the following API address: http://hq.sinajs.cn/list=sh600519
By sending an HTTP GET request to the above API address, you will receive a response containing the real-time quote data for the stock.

2. Get Historical K-line Data for Stocks:
API Address: http://money.finance.sina.com.cn/quotes_service/api/json_v2.php/CN_MarketData.getKLineData?symbol=[Stock Code]&scale=[Time Period]&ma=[Moving Average Period]&datalen=[Data Length]
Example: To get the daily K-line data for the stock code "sh600519" (Kweichou Moutai), you can use the following API address: http://money.finance.sina.com.cn/quotes_service/api/json_v2.php/CN_MarketData.getKLineData?symbol=sh600519&scale=240&ma=no&datalen=1023
By sending an HTTP GET request to the above API address, you will receive a response containing the historical K-line data for the stock.
"""

# Build the path to the tools directory
project_root = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
tools_directory = os.path.join(project_root, "tools")

# If the tools directory does not exist, create it
if not os.path.exists(tools_directory):
    os.makedirs(tools_directory)

print(f"Tools directory created: {tools_directory}")

# Use the agent to generate tool code
agent.create_tool(text, tools_directory=tools_directory)
```
Executing this will generate 2 files in the tools directory: get_stock_kline_data.py and get_stock_realtime_data.py

### 4. Tree of Thought (ToT)
Built-in thought tree module supports complex task decomposition and multi-step reasoning. Through the Tree of Thought, the agent can better handle complex tasks.

```python
# Activer l'arbre de pensée
agent = LightAgent(
    model="gpt-4.1", 
    api_key="your_api_key", 
    base_url= "your_base_url", 
    tree_of_thought=True,  # Activer l'arbre de pensée
    tot_model="gpt-4o", 
    tot_api_key="sk-uXx0H0B***17778F1",  # Remplacez par votre clé API deepseek r1
    tot_base_url="https://api.openai.com/v1",  # url de l'API
    filter_tools=False,  # Désactiver le mécanisme d'outils adaptatifs
)
```
Après avoir activé ToT, le mécanisme d'outils adaptatifs est activé par défaut. Si vous souhaitez le désactiver, veuillez ajouter le paramètre filter_tools=False lors de l'initialisation de LightAgent.

### 5. Multi-Agent Collaboration
Supports swarm-like multi-agent collaboration to enhance task processing efficiency. Multiple agents can collaborate to complete complex tasks.

```python
from LightAgent import LightAgent, LightSwarm
# Set the environment variables OPENAI_API_KEY and OPENAI_BASE_URL
# The model defaults to gpt-4o-mini

# Create a LightSwarm instance
light_swarm = LightSwarm()

# Create multiple agents
agent_a = LightAgent(
    name="Agent A",
    instructions="I am Agent A, a front desk receptionist",
    role="Front desk receptionist responsible for receiving visitors and providing basic information guidance. Please introduce your identity before each response, and you may only guide users to other roles, not directly answer customers' business questions. If you cannot resolve the user's question, please reply: I'm sorry, I cannot provide help at the moment!",
)

agent_b = LightAgent(
    name="Agent B",
    instructions="I am Agent B, responsible for booking meeting rooms",
    role="Meeting room reservation administrator, responsible for processing reservations, cancellations, and inquiries for rooms 1, 2, and 3. Please introduce your identity before each response and politely respond to users' queries.",
)

agent_c = LightAgent(
    name="Agent C",
    instructions="I am Agent C, a technical support specialist responsible for technical issues.
